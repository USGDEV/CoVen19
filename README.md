# Pandemic Ventilator Design Guideline
This is a specification of the minimally (and some preferred options) clinically acceptable ventilator to be
used in UK hospitals during the current SARS-CoV2 outbreak. It sets out the clinical requirements based on the consensus of what is ‘minimally acceptable’ performance in the opinion of the anaesthesia and intensive care medicine professionals and medical device regulators...Read more on official page https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-ventilator-supply-specification/rapidly-manufactured-ventilator-system-specification

# Source Code
### [Please find full source code here for v0.5](https://github.com/USGDEV/CoVen19/tree/master/SOURCE/Arduino/CoVen19_release_v0.7)

```C++

//Forward/reverse stepping function
void ForwardBackwardStep()
{
  Serial.println("Alternate between stepping forward and reverse.");
  for(x= 1; x<5; x++)  //Loop the forward stepping enough times for motion to be visible
  {
    //Read direction pin state and change it
    state=digitalRead(dir);
    if(state == HIGH)
    {
      digitalWrite(dir, LOW);
    }
    else if(state ==LOW)
    {
      digitalWrite(dir,HIGH);
    }

    for(y=0; y<1000; y++)
    {
      digitalWrite(stp,HIGH); //Trigger one step
      delay(1);
      digitalWrite(stp,LOW); //Pull step pin low so it can be triggered again
      delay(1);
    }
  }
  Serial.println("Enter new option:");
  Serial.println();
}

```

# Enclosure
Enclosure design based on laser cutting of 5mm acrylic or pvc sheet, normally available easily in market. 5mm sheet cutting is quick and sturdiness will be good enough to hold ventilator assembly all together, enclosure is essential to handle the ventilator without damaging internal parts.

### [Here is DXF 2D files provided for laser cutting v0.7](https://github.com/USGDEV/CoVen19/tree/master/CoVen19_v0.7/DXF)
